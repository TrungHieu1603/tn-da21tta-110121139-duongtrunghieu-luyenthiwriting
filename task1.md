The line graph shows changes in the number of international students studying at universities in the UK, USA and Australia between 2005 and 2015.

Overall, all three countries experienced an increase in international student numbers over the decade, with the USA maintaining the highest numbers throughout the period. The most significant growth was seen in Australia.

Starting with the USA, international student numbers rose steadily from approximately 450,000 in 2005 to around 750,000 in 2015. The UK also showed consistent growth, beginning at about 300,000 students and reaching roughly 500,000 by the end of the period.

Australia, despite having the lowest initial numbers at around 150,000 in 2005, demonstrated the most dramatic increase. Numbers grew rapidly between 2005 and 2010, nearly doubling to 300,000, and continued to rise sharply to reach approximately 450,000 by 2015, almost matching the UK's figures.

In conclusion, while all three countries attracted more international students over the decade, Australia's growth rate was particularly noteworthy, suggesting increasing popularity as a study destination.
