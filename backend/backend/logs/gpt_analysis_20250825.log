[01:57:28] Context: Great to hear that you are going to visit Dubai! I'm sure you will have a wonderful time there. Don't worry, I'll look after your house and your pet while you are away. I just want to know the time you leave for Dubai and when you will be back. I don't have a lot of experience looking after animals, so tell me how to care for your pet. Also, are there any other household duties I am supposed to do?

Lots of love,
Brianna
